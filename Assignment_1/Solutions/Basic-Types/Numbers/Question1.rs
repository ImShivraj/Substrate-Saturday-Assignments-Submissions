// Question 1 Solution:

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let mut y = 5;

    y = x;
    
    let z = 10; // Type of z is i32 

    println!("Success!");
}

/* 
Explantion/What I understood:

1. changed the type of y by making it mutable and the making it equal to x hence it gets i32 as type.
2. type of z is i32.
